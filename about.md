Hey there, my name is Nami, and I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Aalto University.

This website is dedicated to sharing my progress in game development and providing insights into my background and interests. I'm proficient in Unreal Engine and enjoy exploring new concepts related to game development, particularly where gameplay, AI, and animation intersect.

My experience includes working with animation components such as blending, layering, and state machines, as well as AI components such as behavior trees, smart objects, state trees, environment query systems, and AI perception.

If you wish to contact me, please feel free to reach out via email.
