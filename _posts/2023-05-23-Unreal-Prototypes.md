# Prototypes

Here, I present a compilation of numerous prototypes I have meticulously crafted using the powerful Unreal Engine. These prototypes showcase my creative and technical prowess, providing a glimpse into my diverse range of skills and expertise.Here I have listed several prototypes I have dveloped in unreal engine.

**It is important to note that the purpose of a prototype is to explore and test what can be achieved, so it may not necessarily have high visual quality.**


## Multi-AI Coordination

Coordinating multiple AI systems can be a complex undertaking. In this ongoing prototype, I have developed various AI entities that are overseen by a central manager. Each AI relies on its perception abilities to detect the player. Once a player is detected, the AI seeks guidance from the manager regarding the appropriate course of action. The manager assumes the responsibility of coordinating the different AI systems and employs EQS (Environment Query System) to identify suitable locations for each AI to carry out their tasks effectively.

## Smart Objects

a small prototype of replicated smart objects for AI agents. Smart objects contain behaviors that AI can perform when using those specific objects. In general, AI agents query the environment to locate a smart object, then proceed to claim and use it. If an agent has already claimed a smart object, other agents cannot claim and use it.

## Boss battle

An old prototype of a boss battle using behavior trees. Each behavior tree is consist of several selectors, sequences, decorators, services and of course lots of tasks. During this prototype I have created custom decorators, sevices and tasks.
