In this blog post, I will share my experience and knowledge about smart objects in Unreal Engine. My aim is to provide useful insights for anyone who is interested in learning about smart objects in UE4.

**This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of fundamental AI tools available in Unreal Engine, including behavior trees, blackboards, and EQS. Additionally, the reader is expected to be familiar with C++. Please note that this tutorial is geared towards intermediate to advanced users and may not be suitable for beginners.**

Bobby Anguelov and Jeet Shroff gave an excellent talk about smart objects which serves as a great introduction to the topic. In fact, I'll be using it as my main reference. I'm curious to see how closely Unreal Engine matches their ideas, and how we can achieve similar functionality.
